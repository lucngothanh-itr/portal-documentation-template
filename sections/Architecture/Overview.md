# Architecture Overview

Last Updated: April 22, 2025

## Introduction

The [PORTAL_NAME] portal is built using [FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK] and interacts with the BTCY BioFlux backend microservices ecosystem. This document provides an overview of the portal's architecture and its integration with the backend services.

## Portal Architecture

### Frontend Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [FRAMEWORK] (React/Angular/Vue)
- **State Management**: [STATE_MANAGEMENT] (Redux/MobX/Vuex/etc.)
- **UI Library**: [UI_LIBRARY] (Material-UI/Ant Design/etc.)
- **API Client**: [API_CLIENT] (Apollo Client/Relay/etc.)
- **Build Tool**: [BUILD_TOOL] (Webpack/Vite/etc.)

    style BE fill:#fbb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Integration with Backend Services

The [PORTAL_NAME] portal primarily interacts with backend services through the GraphQL Gateway, which federates schemas from multiple microservices.

```

### Key Service Integrations

| Service | Purpose | Features Used |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Auth Service | User authentication and authorization | Login, Registration, JWT handling |
| Admin Service | Administrative operations | User management, System settings |
| Billing Service | Billing and payments | Payment processing, Invoicing |
| Clinic Service | Clinic management | Appointment scheduling, Patient records |
| Device Management | Device operations | Device monitoring, Provisioning |
| Support Service | User support | Ticket management, Knowledge base |

## Authentication Flow

The portal uses JWT-based authentication, following this flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Portal
    participant Gateway
    participant AuthService
    
    User->>Portal: Login with credentials
    Portal->>Gateway: Authentication request
    Gateway->>AuthService: Validate credentials
    AuthService->>Gateway: Return JWT token
    Gateway->>Portal: Return JWT token
    Portal->>Portal: Store token in localStorage/cookies
    Portal->>User: Redirect to dashboard
    
    Note over Portal,AuthService: Subsequent requests include JWT in header
```

For more details on authentication, see [Authentication Flow](Authentication-Flow).

    S1 -->|Response| GW
    S2 -->|Response| GW
